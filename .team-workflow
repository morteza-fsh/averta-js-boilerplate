//==================== Grunt & Bower =================

npm install -g grunt-cli
npm install -g bower

// Install packages
npm install

// Install bower dependencies (not required)
bower install


//==================== Git & WorkFlow ================

// Add your fork as origin (already done after fork)
git remote add origin git@bitbucket.org:your-user-name/project.git
// Add main repo as upstream
git remote add upstream git@bitbucket.org:your-team/project.git

// 1. To work on new feature, create new branch from develop branch (example: new-feature-branch )
git checkout -b new-feature-branch develop

// 2. Do you changes and commit them then push changes to origin
git push origin new-feature-branch

// 3. Now changes are available on your remote fork, go to your forked repo on bitbucket and pull request changes
// 4. You need to wait for reviewer to check and merge your changes in main repo
// 5. When your changes were accepted and merged into main repo you need to get latest changes from main repo (upstream)
//    and delete your branch as well (you don't need it anymore).
git checkout develop
git pull upstream develop
git branch -d new-feature-branch

// The process will be repeated for next feature too.
